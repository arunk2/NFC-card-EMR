Near Field Communication (NFC) Cards for Electronic Medical Records (EMR)

##NEAR FIELD COMMUNICATION
Near Field Communication (NFC) is a short-range wireless connectivity technology that enables exchange of data between devices and tags over a distance of up to about 10 centimeters.

Features of NFC
NFC can be used in both read and write mode, operating at 13.56 MHz with data transfer rates at 106, 212 or 424 Kbits/second. Communication between two 
NFC-compatible devices occurs when they are brought within about 5 centi-meters of one another. A swipe or touch can establish an NFC connection. The underlying layers of
NFC technology follow universally implemented ISO, ECMA, and ETSI standards.

MIFARE NFC Card
In general, two types of RFID cards are used, active and passive cards. While active systems have an own source of energy, passive systems rely on the energy provided by the card readers.
One of the most common RFID Cards is the MIFARE Classic, produced by NXP Semiconductors. The MIFARE offers different types of cards, which are all passive and fully compliant with ISO/IEC 14443 Type A.
We used MIFARE Classic 1K for our experiments.
